# 🥊 Fight Central

**Fight Central** is a full‑stack web application that displays MMA fighters and their details using data from the open **Octagon API**. The app is built with a modern VILT stack — **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, **Vue 3**, and **Tailwind CSS** — and demonstrates a clean server‑driven SPA experience without a separate API backend.  

The goal of this project is to explore a real‑world API integration, build responsive UI, and learn full‑stack application architecture suitable for portfolio and practical use.
